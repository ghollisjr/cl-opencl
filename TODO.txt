  + Start OpenGL intercommunication

+ Add raw foreign memory argument support to memory read/write
  functions.  Should probably add separate functions,
  e.g. cl-enqueue-write-buffer-foreign.  The main bottleneck of the
  current read/write Lisp layer is converting between Lisp and foreign
  memory.  Many times it is possible to work directly with foreign
  memory without needing to convert to Lisp, so if this is possible
  for an application, that application should have access to a Lisp
  API without the nasty overhead of converting everything to and from
  foreign memory.
